Any Questions?

+(seriously)

---- i4
== YAML - YAML Ain't Markup Language

Q: What is YAML? (According to the Internet)
A: YAML is a Serialization Language

From Wikipedia:

    * XML  is a ... MARKUP LANGUAGE...
    * JSON is a ... DATA INTERCHANGE FORMAT
    * YAML is a ... DATA SERIALIZATION FORMAT

+   YAML is THE ONLY interlingual *Data Serialization* Language.

    [ Ruby, Perl, Python, PHP, Java, Haskell, JavaScript ]

---- i4
== YAML - YAML Ain't Markup Language

XML - JSON - YAML

All of these technologies are "interlingual data languages".





.
---- i4
== YAML - YAML Ain't Markup Language

XML - JSON - YAML

All of these technologies are >>>>>>> "Acmeist"!

+   Acmeism - Technologies that are programming language agnostic.

* TestML - is my latest Acmeist project
  * More about it later
* C'Dent - is my next Acmeist project
---- i4
== YAML - YAML Ain't Markup Language

Q: What is YAML? (According to the Ingy.net)
A: YAML is a Language for Data

* Programs have lots of languages
* Data has only a few. XML, JSON, ASN.1
* YAML is Human Friendly
* When Data is well organized, Programming is easier

---- perl,i4
# Obfuscated YAML, FTW!
$VAR1 = bless( {
                 'ARRAY(0x80f640)' => '...',
                 'HASH(0x80f5b0)' => '\' {@#$%}'
               }, 'main' );

---- yaml,i4
# Five style of scalars

plain: this is subject to implicit typing
single: 'won''t be subject to implicit typing'
double: "can contain \"Any Value\" \n\x7c\u206e"

# Flow Collections

== Flow Collections

* YAML has Block and Flow Collections
* Flow can occur inside Top, Block or Flow
* Block can occur only in Top or Block
* Flow supports all same model as Block
* JSON is a pure subset of YAML

# JSON is YAML

{"ingy":"yaml"}

The State of the YAML

The Bad, the Good and the Ingy

----
== YAML - The Bad

* Started in April 2001 (over 8 years ago)
  * Still not rock solid
  * JSON was 2005 and quickly solid
* Many Incompatible Implementations
  * YAML.pm, Syck, XS, Perl, Tiny
* Very complex specification
  * 1.2 specification is not released yet
  * No implementation (not even libyaml) fully matches the 1.2 spec
* Terrible vim syntax highlighting

----
== YAML - The Good

* Fairly Ubiquitous - Everybody's using it
* Acmeism - Works for all modern programming languages
* Very complete language
  * Simple for simple stuff
  * Deep for hard stuff
* New O'Reilly book and OSCON talk!
* New tools in Perl!

----
== YAML - The Ingy

* Ingy is 1 of the 3 authors of YAML
* Ingy is the only Perl person of the 3
* Everyone *assumes* Ingy will do everything YAML related
  * These days, even Ingy assumes this
* Ingy is not the best Perl programmer
* But he's getting better...
+* He's copying other people's work!

---- yaml,i2
# Quick YAML Vocabulary Lesson for Mongers
- directive:  %YAML or %TAG line
- stream:     A complete (to eof) YAML file
- document:   A single top level object
- mapping:    A hash (ref)
- sequence:   An array (ref)
- collection: A map or seq
- scalar:     A scalar
- node:       A map, seq or scalar
- anchor:     A label of a node
- alias:      A reference to a anchored node
- block:      Indented scoping
- flow:       Curly/Square scoping
- literal:    HEREDOC
- dump:       Perl to YAML
- load:       YAML to PERL

----
== Introduction to Ingy döt Net

* Ingy is attracted to mixing programming languages
* See http://github.com/ingydotnet/
* Perl, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Perl6
* They are all basically the same
* Inline, YAML, TestML, CogBase,
  Jemplate, pQuery, C'Dent, WikiText
* Modules, People, Communities, Jobs

+* Ingy believes in Acmeism

----
== Ingy's TPF Grant

* YAML has a Spec (1.2)
* Anyone can implement it (not easy)
* Everybody assumes Ingy will implement it
* In Fall of 2006 I received a $3000 grant
* To port PyYAML to Perl
* I bound libyaml to Perl 6 months later
* libyaml is a port of PyYAML
* Two years later I am almost finished with YAML::Perl

----
== YAML Theory

* Model
* Stack
* Events
* Schema

---- yaml,i4
# YAML Data Model
---
+start with:
  hashes: collections
  which: map
  keys: values
+add:
  - arrays
  - sequences
  - of data
+plus: scalars
+mix in: !type "of data"
+references: *to_the_past
+...
  
----
== What is the difference between the YAML Model and the JSON Model?

* JSON only supports arrays and string-keyed-maps

* YAML adds data references/pointers
** Allows cyclic data
* YAML adds an extensible type system
** All nodes are typed
** Usually implicitly

----
        JSON Model Grammar

    JSON   := (MAP | ARRAY)
    NODE   := (MAP | ARRAY | SCALAR)
    MAP    := (STRING, NODE)*
    ARRAY  := NODE*
    SCALAR := (string | number | boolean | null)

        YAML Model Grammar

    YAML := NODE*
    NODE := (typed)(MAP | ARRAY | SCALAR | ALIAS)
    MAP := (NODE, NODE)*
    ARRAY := NODE*
    SCALAR := typed_string

* STREAM_START
* STREAM_END
* DOCUMENT_START
* DOCUMENT_END
* MAPPING_START
* MAPPING_END
* SEQUENCE_START
* SEQUENCE_END
* SCALAR
* ALIAS

* SCALAR value="bar"
* ALIAS anchor="list"
* MAPPING_END
* DOCUMENT_END

* SCALAR value="Goodbye"
* DOCUMENT_END

----
== Schema - The Meaning of YAML - The Grey Zone

Q: How do you know what a random YAML document means?
+A: You don't!

+* YAML meaning is context sensitive
* It is a contract between a Loader and a Dumper
* It is a contract between two developers
* It is validated by a test system
* The contract does not (yet) have a formal standard
* YAML will someday have a formal schema language
  * Y-OK and Rx are attempts
* For now it is a programmer understanding
* Backed by good tests, when needed

----
== YAML::Perl

* Port of Python's PyYAML to Perl
* Line for Line port
* 16 Python Modules
* 6000 lines of Python
* libyaml is a port of PyYAML
  * YAML::Perl should match YAML::XS
* SnakeYAML for Java
* PyYAML is Reference Implementation
* Full YAML Stack Access
* Detailed error messages

---- perl
# YAML::Perl example code.

use YAML::Perl::Events;
use YAML::Perl::Emitter;

my $emitter = YAML::Perl::Emitter->new();
$emitter->open();

for (qw(
    YAML::Perl::Event::StreamStart
    YAML::Perl::Event::DocumentStart
    YAML::Perl::Event::MappingStart
    YAML::Perl::Event::Scalar,foo
    YAML::Perl::Event::Scalar,42
    YAML::Perl::Event::Scalar,bar
    YAML::Perl::Event::Scalar,44
    YAML::Perl::Event::MappingEnd
    YAML::Perl::Event::DocumentEnd
    YAML::Perl::Event::StreamEnd
)) {
    my ($class, $value) = split ',';
    my $event = defined($value)
        ? $class->new(value => $value)
        : $class->new();
    $emitter->emit($event);
}

print ${$emitter->writer->stream->buffer};

----
== YAML::Perl

    - Show ported code
+    - Show ysh -MYAML::Perl
    - Better error messages
+    - Show TestML

----
== YAML::Perl Roadmap

* Port all PyYaml code to YAML::Perl - *DONE*
* Make YAML::Perl pass all PyYaml tests
  * TestML!
* Provide proper Perl/YAML API
* Write the YAML::Perl documentation

+* Get Paid! (by TPF)
----
== YAML2

use YAML-XS;

$clone = Load Dump $yaml;

$object = yaml->load($yaml);

$yaml = yaml(%options)->dump($object);

----
== No more Global UI

* YAML was modeled after Data::Dumper originally.
* Global variable configuration is a really bad idea.
* Moreso for YAML.

    use YAML;
    $YAML::Indent = 4;
    Dump($object);

    yaml(indent => 4)->dump($object);

    # Streaming API
    yaml->emit(yaml->parse($yaml));
----
== YAML2 Transition

* YAML.pm moved to YAML::Old
* YAML2 *dist* installs YAML *module*
* With lots of warnings
  * VERY EXPERIMENTAL
  * WARNING- ***INGY CODE!!!***
* YAML2 proxies to the appropriate
  YAML implementation module.
* When stable, make YAML2 into real YAML.pm.

  use YAML;
  use YAML-Old;
  use YAML '-Old';
  use YAML-XS,-Perl;
----
== YAML News

* YAML 1.2 Spec to be finalized very soon now.
* Ingy Presents YAML @ OSCON
  * YAML serves "The O'Reilly Languages"
* Ingy working on a YAML Book
